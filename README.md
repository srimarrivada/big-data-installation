Hadoop Installation:
Apache Hadoop was introduced to handle Big Data in a distributed manner with parallel computation.

Prerequisites:
The following prerequisites need to be installed before running Hadoop.
1.	JRE 8: Hadoop 3.x requires Java 8 runtime environment (Hadoop 3.3 supports Java 8 and Java 11 while Hadoop 3.0.x to 3.2.x supports Java8 only and Hadoop 2.7.x to 2.10.x support both Java 7 and Java 8). See Hadoop Java versions for more details. 

We can download JRE8 for Windows offline installation from Oracle site.
Additionally, JDK 8 (Java Development Kit) is also needed which can be downloaded from Oracle site.

2.	7zip: 7zip (or any other file archiver that can unzip tar.gz files) is needed to unzip the download Hadoop binaries. 7zip can be downloaded from the official site.
